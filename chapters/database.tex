\chapter{Database management and data mining}
\label{ch:database}
Up to this point, our data was stored in the \textit{data} directory and temporary pickle directory. The database managing container takes this data, ensures consistency, and uploads it to the MySQL database.

How is the data stored so far? How it can be stored?
Why use database? What kinds of engines we can use?
What does the data warehouse contain? What is its purpose?


\section{Program configuration}
What is in config.py file? Which values are shared among containers? Which are
modifiable and which are not?


\section{Used services}
What modules are used in the subproject?
What are the differences in the services?

\subsection{Database service}
What does it do, and how does it do it?


\section{Run scheduling}
How is the run scheduled? What indicators are present?


\section{Tables from staging area}
How do the tables look like when the data is gathered by the first container?
What are the data types?
What data can be missing or faulty?
Do we have any metadata? How can it be used?


\section{Data transformation}
How will the data be transformed?
What new tables will be created?
How will these tables be utilized?

What information is ready to be read right away?
What questions can be answered immediately?
What questions are more complex?
What data can be predicted from the current data?
