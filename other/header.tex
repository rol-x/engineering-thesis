\end{center}
Data warehouses are powerful systems responsible for gathering, storing, managing and transforming the data related to a single problem domain. As the data is processed through the pipeline to generate the wanted results, many different parts of the system are involved. To achieve cross-platform portability, separate independent stages and make the application standalone, containerization of the consecutive steps is introduced. This thesis describes a Docker-based data warehouse management system, related to an online card market data, aiming at providing the user with useful knowledge to improve their buying decisions. \par \noindent
